Project Name :Analysis-of-Tourism-Report-in-India-using-Python-and-Power-BI

Tools Used: Python and Power BI

Dataset : Kaggle.com

Description:

         The Project is about analyzing the dataset which is discribing about the various Tourism Destinations across India with their Rating and the long
discription.So the task is to analyze and visualize the report in PowerBi.The dataset had less data itself such as city name, long discription, Rating and their 
best time to visit.
         The Dataset has been imported to python pandas for data cleaning and data manipulation.Using df.info() the information about the dataset has been read.
The dataset had no null values or duplicate values.So the next step and important step was to create a simple column which tells the region of the city like 
desert or coastal region etc from the long description give.so it has been successfully done for the easy understanding.Then the code has been uploaded to 
Power Bi. There the visualizing part has a table which will has city name and the rating. Also it has three slicers which makes the users to easily identify the
destination and the rating with the long discription box for detailed breakdown.
        The code and PowebBi file has been added and with the image of the Report.
